# FLAMEK8sBackend

A [FLAME](https://github.com/phoenixframework/flame/tree/main) Backend for
Kubernetes. Manages pods as runners in the cluster the app is running in.

The current implementation is very basic and more like a proof of concept.
More configuration options (resources, etc.) will follow.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:flame_k8s_backend, "~> 0.5.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Configure the flame backend in our configuration or application setup:

```elixir
  # application.ex
  children = [
    {FLAME.Pool,
      name: MyApp.SamplePool,
      backend: FLAMEK8sBackend,
      min: 0,
      max: 10,
      max_concurrency: 5,
      idle_shutdown_after: 30_000,
      log: :debug}
  ]
```

## Prerequisites

### Env Variables

In order for the runners to be able to join the cluster, you need to configure
a few environment variables on your pod/deployment:

The `POD_NAME` and `POD_NAMESPACE` are used by the backend to get informations
from your pod and use them for the runner pods (e.g. env variables).

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - env:
            - name: POD_NAME
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  apiVersion: v1
                  fieldPath: metadata.name
            - name: POD_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  apiVersion: v1
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
```

### RBAC

Your application needs run as a service account with permissions to manage
pods:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: app-namespace
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: app-namespace
  name: pod-mgr
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "delete", "patch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod-mgr
  namespace: app-namespace
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: myapp
    namespace: app-namespace
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-mgr
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: my-app
```

### Clustering

Your application needs to be able to form a cluster with your runners. Define
`POD_IP`, `RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION` and `RELEASE_NODE` environment variables on
your pods as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - env:
            - name: POD_IP
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  apiVersion: v1
                  fieldPath: status.podIP
            - name: RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION
              value: name
            - name: RELEASE_NODE
              value: my_app@$(POD_IP)
```

## How it works

The FLAME Kubernetes backend first queries the Kubernetes API server to extract
information from the running Pod like the container image, resource requests and
limits, environment variables etc. This information is then used to build the
manifest for the runner pod. The backend then sends the resulting manifest to
the API server in order to spin up a runner pod.
